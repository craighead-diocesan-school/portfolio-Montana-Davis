    <h2>My Project</h2>
    <p>In our Year 10 Digital Technology class, we built games for people to play at the Year 10 Market Day. My project was Wind Up</p>
  </main>
 <p></p> Wind up is  game where you punch a pillow as hard as you can. The aim is to get the highest score. The pillow is attached to a piece of cardboard with a microbit behind it which calculates the speed and strength and sends a message to another microbit then you can see your score.
