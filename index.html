      <h2>My Project</h2>
      <p>
        In our Year 10 Digital Technology class, we built games for people to play at the Year 10 Market Day. My project was Wind Up
      </p>
      <p>
        Wind up is game where you punch a pillow as hard as you can. The aim is to get the highest score. The pillow is attached to a piece of cardboard with a microbit behind it which calculates the speed and strength and sends a message to another microbit then you can see your score.

        One of the many problems we had was figuring out how we were going to make the Wind Up build and structure. It was quite a easy but difficult process considering we had to be very thoughtful on how things were going to work out. First Zoe, Charlotte and I built a tall rectangle shape out of materials from the Epro8 kits while Amelia did the mirobit coding and the gears. We then built out and added a flat sqaure to the top of our rectangle. From there we build the hanging pillow holder that was used for people to punch so the microbit would swing, hit the top and give us the score.

        Another problem we had was coming up with a way to make the punching pillow and attach it on. We made the pillow out of fabric from the design room and stuffed it with stuffing from other pillows. To get the pillow to attach to the cardboard we used velcro, we put 3 rows of velcro onto the pillow and 3 onto the cardboard so it would attach on.

        One of the many problems we had with building our Wind Up was figuring out how we were going to make our boxing glove that sat on the top. With our first attempt we blew up a balloon and covered it in clay but we realsied it didn't look quite right since it was to big and round. We decided to scrap that idea and start again. This time we actually decided to think it through a little more and we came up with making it out of paper and tin foil. We tested it out and it worked out really well so we kept our first attempt. To get the glove shape we screwed up a bunch of paper and covered them in tinfoil then we bunched it up so it was tight and looks like a boxing glove. For the cuff of the glove we cut an old chocolate powder tin and hot glued it on to the glove. Once we were happy with the shape we had to cover it in clay, it started off as a slow process but didn't take to long. Once the clay had dried we painted it red with a bit of pink highlighting to even it out and we painted the cuff black. Figuring out how we were going to attacht the glove to the frame was a bit challenging, we ened up using zip ties. We poked holes into the cuff and slipped the zip ties through and tied them to the top of our Wind Up.

        The lead up to market day wasn't to bad. We finished within the time frame, all we had left to do was tie it down to a desk so the pillow would be at a good punching hight for all students. Zoe, Ameila and I went on a search for some desks. We found 4 blue singular desks so we took them back to the digi room where we got told by Mr Hullen that they weren't the right ones. We then found a longer brown desk that we used instead and tied the Wind Up down with some rope.

      <p>
        On the day of Market Day we set up the Wind Up, we put in on the table and tied it down with rope. So it was secure we went and got a hammer and some tent pegs from the dungen and hammered the rope into the ground so it was nice and stable. Everything was set up nicely and the glove was spinning round and round because of the gears. When customers started to arrive we were really confident everything was going to work out wonderfully, but there were a few things that didn't quite work out. One thing that didn't quite work was the velcro on the pillow. I think we definetly underestimated how stong people were at punching and how weak the velcro would have been. When everyone had a punch the pillow would constantly be flying off and we would have to reattach it. That was very annoying. We also set the Wind Up very close to the edge of the table so those who had a very hard punch we would have to hold it down and put quite alot of pressure on it. That was also very annoying.

        Overall I think it went really well and lots of people were interested in what it was so that was a great sign. We made 30 dollars overall but gave 10 away since that was the prize it you were at the top of the leaderboard by the end of the day. We then had 20 dollars meaning we got 5 each.
